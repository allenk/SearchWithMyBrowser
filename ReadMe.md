Since April 28ᵗʰ 2016, Cortana opens searches only in Microsoft Edge to prevent users from using another search engine than Bing.  
SearchWithMyBrowser is a little utility that associates itself with the `microsoft-edge:` protocol, used by Cortana to open Edge. After parsing the request to make sure it's a valid URL, it will redirect it to your default browser.

## Building the program

Note to users: It is not required to build the program anymore. See precedent section for installation instructions.  

Optional dependencies:
- [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) **Unicode** - To build the installer.
- [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk), version 10.0.14393 or higher - To build the Store package.

If you decided to build the installer, make sure that `ISCC.exe` is in your path. If you decided to build the store package, make sure that `makeappx.exe` is in your path. See [this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/) for instructions.  

To build the whole project (including the installer and the store package), run the `Make.cmd` file at the root of the repository. You can also build subcomponents individually by running the `Make.cmd` file present in their folder.
